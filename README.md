# Image Caption Generator

## Overview

The Image Caption Generator is a deep learning project that takes an image as input and generates a meaningful caption describing the contents of the image. It is trained on the Flickr8k dataset and utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve accurate and contextually relevant image captions.

## Features

- **Image Captioning:** The core feature of the project is its ability to generate descriptive captions for input images.
- **Deep Learning:** Utilizes a deep learning model (e.g., CNN-LSTM) to extract image features and generate captions.
- **Flickr8k Dataset:** Trained on the widely used Flickr8k dataset, which contains a diverse range of images and corresponding captions.
- **Python:** The project is implemented using the Python programming language.
- **User-Friendly:** Provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for generating captions for images.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning:** The project relies on deep learning techniques and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training and inference.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for implementing the project.
- **Flickr8k Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **OpenCV:** Used for image preprocessing and handling.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes NLP techniques to generate coherent and contextually relevant captions.
